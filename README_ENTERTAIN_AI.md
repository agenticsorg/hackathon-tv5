🎬 EntertainAI — From Scrolling to Knowing

Reinventing Media Discovery with AI

🎯 The Challenge

Every night, millions of people spend 30–45 minutes just deciding what to watch.

Not watching.
Not relaxing.
Not learning.

Choosing.

The problem is not content scarcity — it’s decision overload caused by fragmented platforms.

🌀 The Problem: Doom Scrolling

Today’s algorithmic systems:

Maximize watch time, not satisfaction

Drive endless feeds

Create burnout and decision fatigue

Benefit platforms over people

📸 Visual framing the pain:

🌱 The Shift: Bloom Scrolling

We are moving discovery from:
Reaction → Intention

From:
Algorithms watching behavior
To:
AI understanding people

We don’t serve feeds.
We serve people.

🧠 Our Solution: Conversational Discovery

Instead of scrolling:

You talk.
The AI understands.
Results appear instantly.
